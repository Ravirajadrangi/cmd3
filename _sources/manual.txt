Documentation
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The documentation of cmd3 is maintained at 

* http://cloudmesh.github.com/cmd3/

Installation
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Install from Pypi
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. todo:: pypi installation

::

   pip install cmd3

Install from Source
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We recommend that you use virtual env for installing this package, but
you can naturally also install it in other ways. To use virtual env
you may consult with its manaul. We assume we create a virtual env
called CMD3::

   virtualenv ~/CMD3
   ~/CMD3/bin/activate

Next you need to get the source code from git as follows and conduct
the instalation

::

   git clone git@github.com:futuregrid/cmd3.git
   cd cmd3
   python setup.py install


Running the installed version
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now you are ready to run the shell with the command::

  cm

Which will give you something like this::

  > activate activate
  > activate bar
  > activate clear
  > activate edit
  > activate foo
  > activate metric
  > activate opt_example
  > activate pause
  > activate rst
  > activate template

  cm> 

It first prints the plugins that it found, loads them and than starts
the shell. As we use the shell to develop a much larger shell for
clouds (which we call cloudmesh) you will see a welcome
message. Cloudmesh is available on github at
http://cloudmesh.futuregrid.org. Please note that cloudmesh is under
development and you can actively help us while joining the cloudmesh
project.

Running from the Source Directory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This will install you code in to the site-packages directory. If you
do not want to install the package, you can also go into src/cmd3
where you can find the shell.py program. Now you can alternatively
start it with::

  python shell.py



Using the Shell
----------------------------------------------------------------------

.. todo:: using the shell

The shell is easy to use and you can get started by exploring the
available commands simply by saying::

  help

It will list you a number of commands that are available to you. some
of them will be located in your plugin directories where you can place
additional plugins. Upon start of cmd3 the plugins will be reread and
all of them, including new once, will be available to you.

Extending the Shell
----------------------------------------------------------------------

CMD3 allows you to extend the commands provided in via plugin directories. 
We assume the following directory structure::

  ./shell.py
  ./plugins/foo.py 
  ./plugins/bar.py 
  ./plugins/activate.py 
 
   ... other dirs and file ...

We provide a simple example of how to write and add new classes via
the plugin directory in this manual.

Let us assume that `foo` and `bar` contain some classes that include
the usual do_ methods yo may know from cmd. However in addition to the
do_ method it also includes an
activate method that is called with the activation module, so you can
control its behavior upon startup. This is similar to an __init__
method, but we decided not to name them __init__ in order to highlight
that they are called only at the activation of the plugin.

To specify the plugins please use in the shell.py code::

  plugins = ["foo", "bar","activate"]

Now you can set a name for your class::

  name = "CmCLI"

The rest is pretty simple::

  (cmd, plugin_objects) = DynamicCmd(name, plugins)
  cmd.activate(plugin_objects)
  cmd.cmdloop()


Many times you may want to provide some better location for your
plugins such as system wide installed plugins, or plugins maintained
in your user environment rather than the current path. For this reason we provide the following examples.

Reading plugins from your local instalation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We assume you have placed a plugin directory at
"~/.futuregrid/cmd3/". Than you simply can read the plugins by ::

  plugin_path = os.path.expanduser("~/.futuregrid/cmd3/")

  plugins = get_plugins(plugin_path)

Naturally you can have other plugin directories. In fact we will be
expanding our plugin module called plugin so users could add their own
plugin directories on demand.


Reading plugins from the deploy directory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Assume you like to load the plugins from the deployed cmd3, this can
be done easily while looking at the code for shell.py::

  plugin_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__),'plugins')

  plugins = get_plugins(plugin_path)

Writing Plugins
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Plugins are very simple to design and write. However we have to be
aware of several facts. First, if you design a method with the same
name within two
different plugins, the method from the last loaded plugin will overwrite the previous
method. This is the intended behavior as to allow for easy extensions
to be put in place and overwrite default behaviour. However, you need
to be careful as not to confuse yourself by properly ordering the
plugins upon load loaded.  In
addition we have on purpose not used an __init__ method in the class
but instead used an activate method to indicate that we like in future
to activate and deactivate certain plugins.  

A Basic Plugin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here is the sample class from the file plugins/foo.py::

   class foo:

       def activate_foo(self):
           print "... activate foo"

       def do_foo(self, arg):
           print "I am Foo", arg

Now place this module in your plugins directory and you are all
set. when you start the shell and say::

  foo bar

It will print::

  I am Foo bar
   
This does not seem much different from the original cmd, an in fact it
is not. The only difference so far is the introduction of the plugins
directory. Thus instead of changing my shell.py program, adding
inheritance or other mechanisms and making sure I invoke the right
__init__ methods, all this is not needed here.

This has advantages and disadvantages and you may judge for yourself,
if you like to use a plugin or an inheritance mode.

Argument parsing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

One of the important differentiation to the original cmd is how we are
handeling documentation. Although it is possible to use just the same
mechanism as in cmd, Cmd3 also allows the use of docopts. This has the
advantage that we can very quickly design prototypes of commands with
nice option parsing based on the documentation that is provided with
the method as documented at http://docopt.org.

So let us create a new plugin called bar::

   from cmd3.cyberaide.decorators import command

   class bar:

       def activate_bar(self):
           print "... activate bar"

       @command
       def do_bar(self, arg, arguments):
           """Usage:
                   bar -f FILE
                   bar FILE
                   bar list

            This command does some useful things.

            Arguments:
                  FILE   a file name

            Options:
                  -f      specify the file

            """
            print arguments

Please note the differences to our previous class. We have introduced a
decorator that transforms the do_bar method into a method that returns
an additional parameter called arguments. This is the arguments dict
that is created by `docopt` and allows for some very convenient
introduction of handeling the parameters, arguments, and options.  If
you like to find more out about docopts please visit the `website`_ ,
which also includes some nice `examples`_ to show the use of docopt in
python.



Generating Information  
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Often it is good to provide some summary information about a module
that you have installed. As each package may have such information we
have implemented the `info` command that prints out all information from
all modules if available

So let us enhance the previous plugin while adding an information::

   from cmd3.cyberaide.decorators import command

   class bar:

       def activate_bar(self):
           print "... activate bar"

       def info_bar(self):
           print "information for the class bar"

       @command
       def do_bar(self, arg, arguments):
           """Usage:
                   bar -f FILE
                   bar FILE
                   bar list

            This command does some useful things.

            Arguments:
                  FILE   a file name

            Options:
                  -f      specify the file

            """
            print arguments

When you call the command::

     cm> info 

from the cm command it will execute the info method fo the class bar.

Function Registration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sometimes you have already developed a function with docopts and
instead of redeveloping it you may just want to add it. Although we
could just register the function as is it is beneficial for us to
still ouse our class concept to organize many differnet
commands. Hence we have developed a function_command decorator, that
accepts an external function so you can specify a new function to the
shell while using the predefined function. After these many words, we
demonstarte this very easily through the following program.  In this
example the command fbar will inherit the documentation form the
function main_func and will also execute it.

.. include:: ../../cmd3/examples/fbar.py
   :literal: 


Build In Commands
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Help
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

One other good feature the above declaration has is that it
automatically registers a help string so you can say::

   help bar

and you will get presented with the manual page

Manual Pages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Often you will run in the situation where you may have to create a
list of manual pages for your commands for your users. To simplify
that we have not provided this in Unix Man format, but simply in RST
format. You can type in the command::

  man

and it will print you in RST format a list of all commands available
to you for your cmd3 shell. This naturally you could put into a sphinx
documentation to create a nice user manual for your users.


Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

CMD3 contains the ability to use variables within the shell. To see a
list of all variables, use the command::

  var list

or simply::

  var

To use the content of the variable, simple use it on the shell with a
dollar sign such as::

  $date

Note that the variables $dat and $time are predefined and give the
current date and time.

Scope
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Often we have to type in a command multiple times. To save
us typng the name of the commonad, we have defined a simple
scope that can be activated with the use command.

You can list the scopes by typing::

  use list

To use a scope simply type::

  use

Scripts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Multiple commands can be stored in scripts. To find out more about
scripts, please execute::

  help script

You can use a script that is stored in a file simply by saying::

  script load filename

where filename is the name of teh file containing the script.

Python
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can execute a python command as follows::

  py COMMAND

where command is the command you like to execute

Quitting the shell
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To quit the shell you can use either the commands::

  q
  quit
  EOF
